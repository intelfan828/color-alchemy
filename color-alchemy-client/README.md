### Game Mechanics

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Game board consists of a grid of tiles (row √ó column) surrounded by source circles
   - All tiles and sources start as black (rgb(0, 0, 0))
   - A target color is randomly generated
   - Limited number of moves available

2. **Color Mixing Rules**
   - First 3 moves: Click sources to paint them red, green, or blue
   - After 3 moves: Drag tiles to sources to create new colors
   - Colors mix based on relative distances and RGB values
   - Color normalization ensures values stay within valid RGB range

3. **Victory Condition**
   - Win by creating a color that matches the target color
   - Color difference must be less than 10%
   - Color difference is calculated using RGB distance formula
